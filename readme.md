This repository is created for the paper "2D and 3D Deep Human Detection by Generating Orthographic Top View Image from Dense Point Cloud" that has been cast. 
 

- We relabeled the [**EPFL RGB-D Pedestrian dataset**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-rgbd-pedestrian/) and public our annotations, see EPFL_mask.zip
- the code will come soon.

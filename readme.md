This repository is created for the submitted paper "2D and 3D Deep Human Detection by Generating Orthographic Top View Image from Dense Point Cloud".
 

- We relabeled the [**EPFL RGB-D Pedestrian dataset**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-rgbd-pedestrian/) and public our annotations, see EPFLmask
- the code will come soon.
